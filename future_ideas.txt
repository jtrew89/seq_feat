-Some way of incorporating open reading frames into the codon counting
-Some way of reading the average of all features for the whole genome/sequences in fasta file
-Some way reading several uninterupted '-'s as a single INDEL and not loads of single INDELS. When giving location is can show a '1' for all positions it spans
